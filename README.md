# E-trach-survey

## Repository Overview

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis related to the pre and post surveys conducted for the eTrack program from Fall 2020 to Spring 2024. The primary goal of this analysis is to assess the impact of the program on various entrepreneurial skills and attitudes.

## Data

Survey Data: The raw survey responses are stored in CSV format.
Statistical Measures: An Excel file provides summary statistics, including mean and standard deviation, for the numerical columns.
Code

## The code is organized into Python scripts that perform the following tasks:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the survey data for analysis.
Statistical Analysis: Calculates mean, standard deviation, and other relevant statistical measures.
Word Cloud Generation: Creates word clouds to visualize the most frequent terms used in pre and post survey responses for each season.
Graph Plotting: Generates bar and error bar charts to compare pre and post survey responses across different seasons and years.
Analysis

## The analysis focuses on the following key areas:

Skill Development: Measures changes in entrepreneurial skills over time, such as ability to make presentations, network effectively, and manage time.
Attitude Shift: Examines changes in participants' attitudes towards entrepreneurship, including their interest in starting a startup and their perceived value of entrepreneurial learning.
Seasonal Trends: Identifies seasonal patterns in survey responses, if any.
Year-over-Year Comparisons: Compares survey results across different years to assess long-term trends.
Findings
